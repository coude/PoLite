# PoLite
This library is designed to facilitate the analysis of far-infrared and 
submillimetre polarimetric data sets. 

The two instruments currently supported are HAWC+ on the Stratospheric 
Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) and POL-2 at the James Clerk Maxwell
Telescope (JCMT). This script will someday include ALMA, APEX, NIKA-2, Planck.
